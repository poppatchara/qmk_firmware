#define SPLIT_TRANSPORT_MIRROR // if this one is enabled the led modes dont sync // This mirrors the master side matrix to the slave side for features that react or require knowledge of master side key presses on the slave side. The purpose of this feature is to support cosmetic use of key events (e.g. RGB reacting to keypresses).
#define SPLIT_LAYER_STATE_ENABLE // This enables syncing of the layer state between both halves of the split keyboard. The main purpose of this feature is to enable support for use of things like OLED display of the currently active layer.
#define SPLIT_LED_STATE_ENABLE // This enables syncing of the Host LED status (caps lock, num lock, etc) between both halves of the split keyboard. The main purpose of this feature is to enable support for use of things like OLED display of the Host LED status.
#define SPLIT_MODS_ENABLE // This enables transmitting modifier state (normal, weak and oneshot) to the non primary side of the split keyboard. The purpose of this feature is to support cosmetic use of modifer state (e.g. displaying status on an OLED screen).
#define SPLIT_ACTIVITY_ENABLE // This synchronizes the activity timestamps between sides of the split keyboard, allowing for activity timeouts to occur.
